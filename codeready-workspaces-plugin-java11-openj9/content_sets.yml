# This is a file defining which content sets (yum repositories) are needed to
# update content in this image. Data provided here helps determine which images
# are vulnerable to specific CVEs. Generally you should only need to update this
# file when:
#    1. You start depending on a new product
#    2. You are preparing new product release and your content sets will change
#
# See https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1023066 for more information on
# maintaining this file and the format and examples
#
# You should have one top level item for each architecture being built. Most
# likely this will be x86_64 and ppc64le initially.
